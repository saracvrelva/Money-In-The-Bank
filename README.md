# Money-In-The-Bank

Small project to simulate the use of a piggy bank and a savings account.
We can withdraw or deposit money and buy things from a list of things (saved in an ENUM). 

This project was done at the beggining of learning Java at <Academia de CÃ³dio_>. It was used to apply the acquired knowledge about OOP, classes, composition and enums.
